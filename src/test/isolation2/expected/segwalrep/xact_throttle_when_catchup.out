-- Test: transaction commits should be throttled when mirror is in
-- catchup state due to a big lag.
-- Throttle test is difficult to automate, this is trying to represent
-- whether transactions being throttled or not by showing a single
-- transaction blocking/unblocking result. The theory is that:
-- generating a bulk inserts to enlarge the WAL lag between primary
-- and mirror;
-- having mirror stay CATCHUP state with syncrep off by suspending
-- 'wal_sender_after_caughtup_within_range' injection point;
-- creating insert transaction with different record size to verify
-- the position of blocking among transaction statements.
